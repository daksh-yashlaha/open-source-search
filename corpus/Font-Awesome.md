Version 5 – the iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework

The internet's most popular icon toolkit has been redesigned and built from
scratch. On top of this, features like icon font ligatures, an SVG framework,
official NPM packages for popular frontend libraries like React, and access to
a new CDN.

Where did Font Awesome 4 (or 3) go?
Now that Font Awesome 5 has been released we are marking version 4 as
end-of-life. We don't plan on releasing any further versions of the 4.x or 3.x.
Documentation is still available but it's moved to
https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0 and
https://fontawesome.com/v3.2.1.
The Git repository for
v4.7.0 and
v3.2.1 can
be found in our GitHub releases.

Upgrading
From time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.
Check out the UPGRADING.md guide when you upgrade your dependencies.
Code of conduct
We will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
Contributing
Please read through our contributing guidelines.  Included
are directions for opening issues.
Versioning
Font Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org.
The major version "5" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:

Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
icon
We will never intentionally release a patch version update that breaks
backward compatibility
A minor release may include backward-incompatible changes but we will
write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
A minor or patch release will never remove icons
Bug fixes will be addressed as patch releases unless they include backward
incompatibility then they will be minor releases

commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

Icons — CC BY 4.0 License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.


Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.


Code — MIT License

In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.



Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.
We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.
